Find tclqBot on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rMyNmUq).

### Status

Basically a copy of the original bot with some edits I deemed better for my bot. There are still things in the main file (MarshtompBot.tcl) that I want to remove that I won't need but it will likely take some time to do that.

Instructions of how to set up the bot is in the wiki.
